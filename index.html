        As i am lacking in information to put on this page, here is some copied text from the example to beef it up a
        bit:
    </h2>
    <p>Introduction to Algorithms Yes, I am coauthor of Introduction to Algorithms, along with Charles Leiserson, Ron
        Rivest, and Cliff Stein. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about the secret to
        writing a best-selling textbook. Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about Introduction to
        Algorithms: Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available? We are currently working on the
        fourth edition. No public release date has been set. If you're wondering whether to hold off buying the third
        edition in anticipation of the fourth edition, I advise you not to wait. Where is the website for the book? The
        MIT Press site is <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms">http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms</a>. Where can I find a list of errata? We maintain an
        errata page that allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an
        incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked
        about. How do I report errors? First, please visit the errata page to verify that the error has not been
        reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an unreported error, send email to
        clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day. Do you correct errors? Yes. Each
        time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time. The
        errata page indicates in which printing each error was corrected. Because we are intensively working on the
        fourth edition, I am no longer posting errors in the third edition. <i>What is the difference between an edition
            and a printing?</i> Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms
        was published in 1990, the second edition came out in 2001, and the third edition appeared in 2009. A printing
        for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the answer to the previous
        question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and third editions. We perturb
        the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing. Can I get solutions to exercises
        and problems? As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of exercises and
        problems. They are posted at the MIT Press website. We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is
        available only to instructors who have adopted the book for course use. The manual has lecture notes and
        solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up
        solutions to all exercises and problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to
        contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the manual site and the files. (Contact information is at the MIT
        Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any of my coauthors. <strong>I will not respond to requests
            for the manual or for solutions.</strong></p>
